# Full Stack Casting Agency API 

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

## Running the server

Ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

**Create DB**
```
createdb <db_name>
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export AUTH0_DOMAIN=dev-b1cng-y2.auth0.com
export API_AUDIENCE=casting
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://gilbertnwankwo@localhost:5432/<db_name>
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Copy the url above and login to generate valid token for each role based user

To run the tests, NB: Update the jwt.py with valid tokens then run
```
dropdb capstone_test
createdb capstone_test
python3 -m unittest test_app.py
```
